On every click on the recyclerview pass the whole array on the second activity.
Then on second activity iterate throught that then display all those items accordingly.
You can use a recyclerview (seems hard) or just dynamically add a view using the codes in 
"Add a view through a button click.text"
This view that you created using the button click is called dynamic view
Use a linearlayout or gridlayout as a container for the dynamically add views. 

see link for adding dynamic views:
