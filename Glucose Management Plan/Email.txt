Glucose Management.rar Hi Hivelabs!;
           I'm John Jordan D. Samaniego, a fresh graduate with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Math major in Computer Science. I want to apply to your company, preferably as an Android Developer. As mentioned on my resume I have used other languages, but I'm more comfortable in Java especially in Android Development. Your company was actually recommended by one of your employees who is my classmate named Ding Harley Catubag. I attach one of my current projects along with my resume. Although the project is not finished yet, but the core functionality is there so I think it's a good medium to measure my skill. I hope I will be given a chance to help your company and also improve my skills. If ever you can contact me via this email or through this contact number 09265436276. That's all,  Hope you're having a good day!
